# Tower of Hanoi

# The objective is to move n number of disks from one tower to another following a set of rules. 
# These rules are as follows: 
# - Only one disk can be moved at a time 
# - Only the upper disk of any of the towers can be moved 
# - Larger disks cannot be placed over smaller disks

# In the optimal scenario of solving the puzzle, 
# the total moves will be 2^n â€“ 1 where n is the number of disks that need to be moved.
