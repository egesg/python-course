# Local scope refers to a variable declared inside a function. 
# For example, in the code below, 
# the variable total is only available to the code within the get_total function. 
# Anything outside of this function will not have access to it.

def get_total(a, b):
    #local variable declared inside a function
    total = a + b
    return total

print(get_total(5, 2))
# 7

# Accessing variable outside of the function:
print(total)
# Exception has occurred: NameError
# name 'total' is not defined
