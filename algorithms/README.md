# Different Types of Algorithms

1. Recursive algorithm
Recursion refers to a method or a function that will call itself. 
It is used to resolve problems by breaking the problem down into sub-problems. 

2. Divide and conquer algorithm
This consists of two parts. 
The first is breaking the problem down into smaller sub-problems and the second is solving the final solution.
- Merge sort
- Quick sort

3. Dynamic programming algorithm
This is mainly used for optimization problems. 
It is similar to the divide and conquer algorithm in that it splits the problems into sub-problems.
- Fibonacci sequence

4. Greedy algorithm
This one finds the best solution in each and every step instead of approaching optimization in a global way.
- Huffman coding
- Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
- Minimum coin change problem

5. Brute Force Algorithm

6. Backtracking Algorithm
This solves a subproblem and if it fails to solve the problem, it undoes the last step and starts again to find the solution to the problem.
- N-Queen problem

# Algorithmic Complexity

1. Time Complexity
2. Space Complexity

### Big-O Complexities (Time and Space)

- Constant: O(1) Excellent
- Linear: O(n)
- Logarithmic: O(n log n)
- Quadratic: O(n^2)
- Cubic: O(n^3)
- Exponential: O(2^n)
- Factorial: O(n!) Horrible
