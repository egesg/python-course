# Object-Oriented Programming (Python is primarily an OOP languge.)

## Key Components of OOP

1. Classes
A class is a logical code block that contains 
    - attributes and (variables)
    - behavior (functions)


2. Objects
An objects is an instance of a class
    - attributes (variables)
    - behaviors (methods)

3. Methods
Methods are functions defined inside a class that determine the behavior of an object instance.


## Concepts of OOP

1. Inheritance
Creation of a new class by deriving from an existing one.
(Parent Class - Child Class)

## Types of interitance in Python
- Simple Inheritance
- Multiple Interitance
- Multi Level Interitance
- Hierarchical Inheritance
- Hybrid Inheritance

MRO (Method Resolution Order) : Determines the order in which a given method or attribute passed is searched
Default order -> bottom to top, left to right

- old style classes used in depth-first search algorithms (DFS)
- new style -> C3 linearization algorithm


2. Polymorphism (having many forms)
A single function can act differetnly depending on the object or the causes.
        
For example:
    Built in "+" Operator
    - integer data type (num1 + num2)
    - string data type (str1 + str2)

3. Encapsulation
        Limits access to method and variables by encasing them in a single unit of scope.
        It prevents unwanted modifications.

4. Abstraction
Hides implementation details for data security.
(Python does not support abstraction directly and uses inheritence to achieve it.)

        
5. Other OOP Concepts
    - Method overloading
    - Method overriding
    - Constructors etc.
