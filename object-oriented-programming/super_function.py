# The super() function is a built-in function that can be called inside the derived class and gives access to the methods and variables of the parent classes or sibling classes. 
# Sibling classes are the classes that share the same parent class. 
# When you call the super() function, you get an object that represents the parent class in return.
# The super() function plays an important role in multiple inheritance and helps drive the flow of the code execution. 
# It helps in managing or determining the control of from where I can draw the values of my desired functions and variables.
# If you change anything inside the parent class, there is a direct retrieval of changes inside the derived class. 
# This is mainly used in places where you need to initialize the functionalities present inside the parent class in the child class as well. 
# You can then add additional code in the child class.


class Fruit():
    def __init__(self, fruit):
        print('Fruit type: ', fruit)

class FruitFlavour(Fruit):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('Apple')
        print('Apple is sweet')

apple = FruitFlavour()
# Fruit type:  Apple
# Apple is sweet


# In the code above, if I had commented out the line for super() function, the output is: 
# Apple is sweet
# This happened because when you initialize the child class, you donâ€™t initialize the base class with it. 
# super() function helps you to achieve this and add the initialization of base class with the derived class.
