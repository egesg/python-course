## Mutability and Immutability

Data Structures can be mutable or immutable.

- Mutability refers to data inside the data structure that can be modified. 
For example, you can either change, update, or delete the data when needed. 
A list is an example of a mutable data structure. 

- The opposite of mutable is immutable. 
An immutable data structure will not allow modification once the data has been set. 
The tuple is an example of an immutable data structure.
